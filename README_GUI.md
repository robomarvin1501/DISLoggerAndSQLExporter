DataPlayer
=========

This README discusses the playback of logger files, along with their attached GUI.  
You should probably first read and understand the standard README.md, along with the nature of logging experiments, 
and the nature of the DIS protocol.  

Files overview
======
- DataPlayer.ui
  - This is an XML file, generated by Qt Designer. It stores the GUI information to be used by python
- DataPlayerUi.py
  - This is a translation of the DataPlayer.ui XML file into python
  - This is achieved through the command: ```pyuic5.bat .\DataPlayer.ui -o DataPlayerUi.py```
- logger_jumping.py
  - A CLI implementation of playing back a logger file. Grants very granular control over everything
  through the available commands.
- logger_playback_api.py
  - Provides a very basic API on localhost over UDP for controlling the playback. 
  - This will allow further frontends (for example written in C#/Unity) that cannot directly 
  interact with python classes
- DataPlayer.py
  - Running this provides the GUI for playing back the file. 
  - The GUI currently has fewer capabilities than the CLI, but still enough for most use. For example, the
  GUI only supports playback speeds that are real numbers in the range of 0-5 inclusive, where the CLI
  allows much finer control.
- timeline.py
  - Provides the _Timeline class, for a (slightly) prettier GUI specifying where in the timeline playback is currently.
